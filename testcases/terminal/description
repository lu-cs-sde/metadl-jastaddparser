Terminals can be constructed using either its Symbol object or its
value String. If the terminal's alias starts with an upper-case
letter, the former is used, otherwise, the latter is used.

Note that if JastAdd is used to generate AST classes, it must be
invoked with the --beaver switch to enable the use of Symbols to 
construct AST objects.
