Definitions can contain optional terminals, denoted by
a question mark.

If the element is the first one in the rule, or if at least
one of its neighbors is not a mandatory terminal symbol, the
rule definition will contain two branches; one with the
element and one without.

Note: If such an optional symbol is used in an action routine,
the generated parser will not compile.
