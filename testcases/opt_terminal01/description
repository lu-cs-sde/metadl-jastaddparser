Definitions can contain optional terminals, denoted by
a question mark.

If the element is not the first one in the rule and all of its
neighbors are non-optional terminal symbols, the non-terminal
will be supplied with a question mark in the generated file as
well.

Note: Beaver returns null in place of this symbol if it is
not present during parsing.
