Definitions can contain optional non-terminals, denoted by
a question mark. If these are referenced in the corresponding
action routine, JastAddParser will ensure the creation of an
Opt node.

The generated parser specification differs depending on where
in the rule the optional element is located:

- If the element is the first one in the rule, or if at least
one of its neighbors is not a mandatory terminal symbol, the
rule definition will contain two branches; one with the
element and one without.

- If the above is not the case, an additional rule will be
created that handles the creation of the Opt node.
